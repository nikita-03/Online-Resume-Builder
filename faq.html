            <p class="ques">What is resume?</p>
            <p> A resume is a formal document that provides an overview of your professional qualifications, including your relevant work experience, skills, education, and notable accomplishments. Usually paired with a cover letter, a resume helps you demonstrate your abilities and convince employers you’re qualified and hireable.</p>
           
            <p>On a base level, a resume is made up of the following five parts:
                <ul>
                    <li>Contact details</li>
                    <li>Introduction</li>
                    <li>Educational background</li>
                    <li>Work history</li>
                    <li>Relevant skills</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p class="ques">Purpose of resume</p>
            <p>The goal of your resume is to convince employers you’re worth interviewing. To that end, your resume is a valuable tool you can use to highlight your experience to prospective employers.

                If your resume provides a concise summary of your relevant qualifications and skills in a format that makes your ability to handle the work as clear as possible, you will get more interviews.

            <p class="ques">What Do I Include on a Resume?</p>
            <p>What you should put on your resume depends on the job you’re applying for and your relevant professional background.
            </p>
            <p>At a minimum, your resume should include the following sections: <br><br>
                
                <li>Contact details:</li>
                <p style="margin-left: 3cm;">Include your first and last name, phone number, and email address. Additionally, you can add your LinkedIn profile if yours is up to date, and your mailing address if you want to prove you live near the place you’re applying.</p> 
                <br>
                <li>Introduction:</li>
                <p style="margin-left: 3cm;">A concise overview of your professional background and key qualifications. Your introduction can be in the form of a resume summary, professional profile, resume objective, or qualifications summary.</p>

                <br>
                <li>Education:</li>
                <p style="margin-left: 3cm;">Include your school names, highest degree earned, majors and minors. Additionally, you can add your GPA (if it’s greater than 3.8) and relevant coursework if you lack experience or it’s related to the position.</p>

                <br>
                <li>Experience:</li>
                <p style="margin-left: 3cm;">List any relevant work experience you have. Include your title, the company you worked for, years worked, and a bulleted list of your key responsibilities and notable successes. Be sure to also include as many relevant accomplishments on your resume as possible.</p>
                
                <br>
                <li>Skills:</li>
                <p style="margin-left: 3cm;">Include any resume skills you possess that are relevant to the position. Be sure to use a strong mix of hard skills and soft skills to demonstrate that you’re a well-rounded candidate.</p>
